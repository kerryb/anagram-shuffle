Anagram Shuffle
===============

When I switched from my iPhone to a Nexus 4, one of the apps I missed was dicwizard.jp's [Anagram](https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/anagram/id373719913?mt=8_).  It's not an anagram solver, or a word game (there are plenty of both of those), but a replacement for scribbling letters in random order on a piece of paper when you're trying to solve an anagram. I couldn't find anything similar in the Android Market, so I decided to write my own (even if that meant inflicting Java on myself again, for more-or-less the first time in five years).

The app is pretty simple &ndash; just enter the anagrams you're trying to solve, click on one, and drag the letters around the screen to your heart's content.

The current version is really little more than a spike (it has no tests, isn't particularly well-organised and probably doesn't use the Android API in the best way), but it seems to work. You can download [AnagramShuffle-1.0.apk](http://dl.dropbox.com/u/17259947/AnagramShuffle-1.0.apk) if you want to give it a try. Maybe when I've finished reading [Responsible Design for Android](https://leanpub.com/ResponsibleDesignAndroid-Part1) I'll rewrite it properly and upload it to Google Play, but don't hold your breath.
